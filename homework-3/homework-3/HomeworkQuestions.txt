    1. Compare and contrast Flexbox and CSS grid, how are they alike and how are they different? 
        - Flex box is a one dimensional layout system where you're going to create smaller layouts or simpler alignments than you would using 
        a CSS grid. 
        - CSS grid is a two dimensional layout system having more control for vertical/horizontal spaces. CSS grid should be used when you need 
        more control over row/columns and if you know your making a large-scale layout. 

    2. Whatâ€™s responsive design in web development and how do we implement it? 
        -Responsive design is when you create dynamic changes to the appearance of a website depending on the device's screen size/orientation being 
        used to open and view the site. This is done using Media queries that allow different CSS rules to apply at different screen widths allowing 
        websites to look good on any device they are on.
