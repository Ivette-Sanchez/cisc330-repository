    1. Define hoisting and closures in JS. 
        - Hoisting:
            - ^Variables and functions within each execution context are created before they are executed → taking all the variables/functions and moving them to the top of the execution context.
        
        - Closure:
            - ^Closures are the ability of a function to remember the variables and functions that are declared in its outer scope→ 

    2. What is PHP? What do server-side languages do in web development? 
        - PHP→ acronym for "PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor"
            - interpreted programming language used to build webpages 
        
        - Server-side scripting language
            -process user input and interact with other servers

    3. What are some examples of how the PHP and JavaScript programming languages are alike and how they differ? 
        - Declaring variables: 
            - Differences:
                - JS→ are declared using things like `var`, `let`, and `const`. 
                - PHP→ are declared using a $ followed by variable name
            - Similatiies→ both don’t need a type declaration.

        - Conditionals:
            - Both JS and PHP use if, if else, and else.

        - Loops:
            - Similatiies→ Both use for, while, and do while loops.
            - Differences:
                - JS→ iterating over object properties or array elements it uses → for...in/for...of loops.
                - PHP→ can use a special foreach loop.


    4. Why pick PHP over another server-side scripting language like Python or Node? 
        - PHP has several useful built-in pieces of functionality
        - When to Choose PHP? (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/php-vs-python-vs-node-js/) 
            - PHP is the proper selection for websites like blogs/web stores that need storage/management of content. 
            - PHP supports excellent rapid application development→ a language that can easily be mixed with HTML ⇒ requires less configuration. 
                - Learning Curve and User-Friendly
                    - PHP has simpler syntax making it easier to learn for beginners. 
                    - ^ is also easier to integrate HTML.
            - It is inexpensive→ PHP is an open-source technology.
            - PHP supports most general basic web application functionality.

    5. Compare and contrast echo and var_dump. 
        - echo→ used to output one or more expressions → prints values.
        
        - var_dump→ dumps information about one or more variables. The information holds type and value of the variables == can print out non-primitive values
