    1. What is the DOM? What is meant by the DOM tree? 
        - DOM== Document Object Model, which is a programming interface for web documents that represents the page, makes it possible for programs to change the document structure/style/content.
        - DOM TREE→ the hierarchical structure of elements →has four main types of nodes:
            - document node == the page
            - element nodes == individual elements
            - attribute nodes == or attributes
            - text nodes == or text

    2. What is an XSS attack? How do they work? How can you guard against them?

        - An XSS attack is also known as a Cross-Site Scripting attack, allowing attackers to gain access to your users accounts. 
            - If a malicious person adds code to an input that is then generated as HTML → that code could possibly be run for different users. → can lead to stealing data, etc.
            - How to guard: 
                - careful with what content you treat as HTML.
                - should very rarely even have the option to show input that came from a user at all
                - if it must → options to validate that input == strip it of potential malicious intent by removing tags/escaping characters.

    3. What is an event in JavaScript? What kind of events can you respond to with code? 
        - EVENTS→ HTML events are "things" that happen to HTML elements --> interactions create events
            - EVENT TYPES: 
                - UI– load/unload/etc
                - Keyboard– keydown, keyup, etc
                - Mouse– click, mouseover, etc
                - Focus– focus
                - Form– submit, 

    4. How does a DOM eventListener work? What are the parameters it is expecting? 
        - Event listeners work by setting up a function that will be called whenever the specified event is delivered to the target → listen for the event by name.
        - I think it’ll be expecting keywords like “click” or “submit” in order to tell it what type of event it will be.

    5. What is jQuery? Why use it? How do we load jQuery onto a page? 
        - jQuery is a JavaScript library that makes it easier to use JavaScript code on your website. 
        - Instead of having a lot of common tasks and lines of JavaScript code jQuery takes these and wraps them into methods that you can call with a single line of code.
            - Why should we use it→ simplifies code => easier to understand and increases developed productivity.
            - ^ “makes our lives easier when doing common HTML/CSS/JS tasks”
        - How to load it: in your HTML under <head> 
            - ^ <script src=”https://code.jquesry.com/jquery-3.7.1.min.js”></script>
 
    6. What is AJAX? JSON? The HTTP method types and what they do?
        - AJAX- Asynchronous JavaScript And XML
            - ^ Makes it possible for web pages to be updated by exchanging data with a web server in the background→ can update parts of a page without reloading/refreshing it.
        - JSON- JavaScript object notation
            - ^ a text-based data format following JavaScript object syntax that uses text that humans can read to store/transmit data objects consisting of attribute-value pairs and arrays.
        - HTTP- stands for Hyper Text Transfer Protocol
            - ^ how the internet handles communication between clients + servers→ done by requests and responses.
        - HTTP Method types:  
            - GET - should only ever retrieve data
            - POST - submits an entity to the specified resource, often causing a change in state/side effects on the server.
            - PUT - updates everything for a resource
            - PATCH - partially modify a resource 
            - DELETE - delete a resource

    7. Write some data in the JSON format. You can use this site https://jsonformatter.org/ to check if it’s in the right format, making use of the “validate” button. 
       
        {
            "name": "Orea",
            "breed": "Chihuahua",
            "age": "12 years old",
            "home": {
                "name": "Highbridge",
                "state": "New York"
            },
            "owner": {
		        "name": "Ivette Sanchez",
	            age": "20 years old"
            }
        }
